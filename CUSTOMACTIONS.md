# Running Custom Actions
First you need to (obviously) define your action, second you have to use it (again: obviously).

## Defining your action
* create a file named `action.yml` in any directory in the project, e.g. ``/.github/customaction``
    * Attention: the file MUST be named ``action.yml``
* Define your action according to [the doc](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action#creating-an-action-metadata-file)

### Hints
* IDEA will recognize ``action.yml`` files as github action files and offer content assist. YAY.
* each ``run`` declaration will need the additional info, in which type of shell the command
should run.
* Valid file names for github actions are:
    * action.yml
    * action.yaml
    * Dockerfile
* Actions can also be created using javascript with node, see [the doc](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action#creating-an-action-metadata-file)

## Using your action
Supposed you've completed the above steps, do the following in your actual workflow file:

* Run ``actions/checkout@v1``
    * if you don't, your action will not be available under a relative path
* Add a ``uses`` step with the relative path to the **directory** containing your action file.

## Example
An example for a custom action can be seen [here](.github/customaction/action.yml) which is used 
[in this workflow](.github/workflows/running_custom_action.yml).

For convenience, here are both files

### Custom Action

```yaml
# .github/customaction/action.yml

name: 'Retag image'
description: ''
inputs:
  source-image:  # id of input
    description: 'Source image'
    required: true
  target-image:  # id of input
    description: 'Target image'
    required: true
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: echo Retagging image from ${{ inputs.source-image }}...
      shell: bash
    - run: |
        docker pull alpine:latest
        docker tag alpine:latest ${{ inputs.target-image }}
      shell: bash
    - run: echo ... and tagging image to ${{ inputs.target-image }}.
      shell: bash

```


### Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/running_custom_action.yml

name: running-custom-action

on: push

jobs:
  run-custom-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: ./.github/customaction
        with:
          source-image: "bla.url.com/image:test"
          target-image: "bla.url.com/image:main"
      - name: Check if target-iamge exists
        run: |
          docker images ls
          docker image ls

```
